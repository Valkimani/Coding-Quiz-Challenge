# Coding-Quiz-Challenge

This code challenge demonstrates how to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

## Steps

<!-- 1. Created index. html
2. Added a boilerplate
3. Added CSS library
4. Create a script.js file
5. Linked it to the index.html
6. Tested the script with "hello world -->

## Build Initial Lander

1. The quiz starts with a start button that reveals the question in the second page by hiding the first page.To reveal all pages, the previous page is hidded until the end of the quiz.DOM variables were created to enable the functions.
2. A timer is triggered by the start quiz button. If the user gets the answer right, time increases and a prompt displaying "correct" shows belwo the answer. If the answer is wrong time is subtracted from the clock and a prompt displaying "correct" shows belwo the answer..
3. When the user answers all questions, the page is hidden to present the next question.
4. After all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, a new page with the scores is dispalyed and the quiz is over.
5. The user has to save their initials and the score to exit the quiz.
